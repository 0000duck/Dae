# Dae

#### What is DAE?
Dae is an under development terminal-like text editor with plugin and LUA scripting support, all written with C# and OpenGL/OpenTK.
The goal of Dae is to be a black box, that is, useless by itself but extremely extendable and configurable, it will only do what you tell it to do.
